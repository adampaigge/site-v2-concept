  <h3>The problems Flux wants to solve.</h3>
  
  
</div>


    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">Australian politics is broken</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        Traditional politicians say one thing to get elected and then do another. Horse trading and back room deals have become more important than good policy, and the will of the people. Powerful lobby groups, and international corporations wield enormous political power, while ordinary Australians have little meaningful say in their country.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">Parliment is not fit for the information age</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        Our parliament is based on the exclusivity of a nineteenth century power structure that doesn't work for the information age. When it comes to the challenges of a modern world, it's just not up to the task. As more information is produced every day than one could read in a lifetime, the demands for governmental specialisation and decentralisation have never been higher. Using some clever technology, Flux will put political power into the hands of those best suited to use it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">“Business as usual” just won't do</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        New policy platforms are not enough to fix this mess. “Business as usual” just won't do. Flux is here to redistribute political power, empower the Australian people through real political participation, and enable specialists to help repair bad policy. Flux will give Australia the framework it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century head on.

  <h3>A change in the way politics is done today</h3>
  
  
</div>


    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">A Gateway to participate directly in parliment</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        Flux is a gateway Australians can use, to participate directly in parliament, making the need for trust in elected officials a thing of the past. Elected Flux MP’s and Senators give up their autonomy and use their votes in line with the outcomes produced by the Flux ecosystem; an ecosystem comprised of ordinary Aussies like you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">An app on your smartphone or computer</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        When Flux is implemented, it will take the form of an app you can access right from your computer or smartphone. You’ll be given a vote on every bill put before Federal Parliament, and can use that vote immediately on the issue at hand, give it to a trusted third party to cast on your behalf, or save it for an issue you care more passionately about later.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb3">
      <h3 class="regular">A vehicle for driving change</h3>
      <p class="mid-gray">
        Flux as a party is a vehicle for driving this systemic political change, with no policy platform beyond parliamentary reform. Flux as a system, is a tool for changing how policy is shaped. It will allow more voices to join the conversation, empower specialists to become politically involved in their fields, and grant Australians direct access to producing better policy for a better Australia.
