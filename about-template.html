  <p>Australian politics is broken. Traditional politicians say one thing to get elected and then do another. Horse trading and back room deals have become more important than good policy, and the will of the people. Powerful lobby groups, and international corporations wield enormous political power, while ordinary Australians have little meaningful say in their country.</p>

<p>  Our parliament is based on the exclusivity of a nineteenth century power structure that doesn't work for the information age. When it comes to the challenges of a modern world, it's just not up to the task. As more information is produced every day than one could read in a lifetime, the demands for governmental specialisation and decentralisation have never been higher. Using some clever technology, Flux will put political power into the hands of those best suited to use it.</p>

<p>  New policy platforms are not enough to fix this mess. “Business as usual” just won't do. Flux is here to redistribute political power, empower the Australian people through real political participation, and enable specialists to help repair bad policy. Flux will give Australia the framework it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century head on.</p>
